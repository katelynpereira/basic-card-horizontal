## Documentation for Business Card

I had wanted to make a business card that was clear on the inside, much like a cut out piece, but it was hard to do so with what I knew in HTML/CSS. I scrapped the idea of doing a clear cut out of the card and went with my logo, which would have been on the opposite side of the card. I also ended up only doing one card since I wanted to do the clear camera themed viewfinder, but now that I have simplifed the card I can see that I could have done two sides of the card with how simple it is now. I used Photoshop to create my logo, as well as the flowery background pattern that is on the card. I wanted the card to be similar to my portfolio website, so it keeps the same thematics. If i could do anything different with this project I would try to work through the issues I had with making the card have a clear section- maybe instead of trying to code it I could try to make the actual card a PNG file? I am still proud of how it turned out nonetheless.
